## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

User stories help us understand the system from the userâ€™s perspective. They guide development by clearly stating what each user wants to do and why.

These stories are based on the main actors:

- Guest
- Host
- Admin

## ðŸ§¾ What's Inside

The file `user-stories.md` includes:

- 5+ user-focused stories for guests (e.g., booking, searching, reviewing)
- Key actions for hosts (e.g., listing properties, managing availability)
- Essential tasks for admins (e.g., monitoring bookings, managing users)

Each story follows the format:
> As a [type of user],  
> I want [to do something],  
> So that [I get some benefit].

This document helps ensure we build features that matter â€” directly aligned with real user needs.
